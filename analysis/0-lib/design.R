# _________________________________________________
# Purpose:
# creates metadata objects for aspects of the study design
# should be sourced (ie `source(".../design.R")`) in the analysis scripts
# defines some look up tables to use in the codebase
# this script should be sourced (using `source(here("analysis", "0-lib", "design.R"))`) at the start of each R script
# _________________________________________________

## TODO: LINK TO PROTOCOL


# Preliminaries ----

## Import libraries ----
library('tidyverse')
library('here')

## Import custom user functions from lib
source(here("analysis", "0-lib", "utility.R"))

## create output directories ----
fs::dir_create(here("analysis", "0-lib"))


# key study dates
# The dates are defined in json format so they can be read in by R and python scripts
# json has no easy way to comment, so explanation for dates is here:
# - firstpossibleax_date is the date from which we want to identify covid vaccines. the mass vax programme was 8 Dec 2020 but other people were vaccinated earlier in trials, so want to pick these people up too (and possibly exclude them)
# - start_date is when we start the observation period, typically at the start of the vaccination campaign (we may restrict the analysis to those vaccinated at a later date if only one product wasavailable at the start)
# - end_date is when we stop the observation period. Most likely the day before the start of the next campaign.

study_dates <-
  jsonlite::read_json(path = here("analysis", "0-lib", "study-dates.json")) |>
  map(as.Date)

# make these available in the global environment
# so we don't have to use `study_dates$start_date` or `start_date <- study_dates$start_date` in each script
list2env(study_dates, globalenv())


# define cohorts ----

# TODO: define cohorts here, eg age_eligible and clinically vulnerable specific for each campaign


# define outcomes ----

# maximum follow-up duration, in days
# currently up to 24 weeks after time-zero

maxfup <- 7L*24L


# Look-up table for all potential outcomes of interest
# this look-up table is used by `create-project.R` to select outcomes that are used in comparisons between products
# comment-out outcomes that are not yet defined in the dataset definition or are otherwise not needed
# - `event` is the variable name prefix used in the dataset, eg for the  `covid_admission_date` variable, the prefix is `covid_admission`
# - `event_var` is the full variable name
# - `event_descr` is the verbose variable name used in summary table/figure outputs
